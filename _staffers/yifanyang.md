Hi! My name is Yifan and I'm really excited to be the TA of CS8 this quater. I'm a second year PhD student in Computer Science, with the focus on the field of Online Convex Optimization, Trustworthy AI and Bayesian Inference. I obtained my bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China in 2021. 

In free time, I like some outdoor activity, like hiking, climbing or kayaking. I also enjoy photography, like landscape, urban photography. So sometimes, I would like to take camera to the downtown, seaside or the mountain top to capture the beautiful scenery. I'd like to know new friends. Feel free to join my office hour to have a talk, I can help you with your course work or just discuss about some interesting things, for both research or life!
