Hello Everyone! My name is Shamita and I am one of your ULA's for CS8 this quarter! I am a 2nd year computer science major and this is my first quarter as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant! 

I am beyond excited to be working with all you guys this quarter and am already proud of you for deciding to venture out and explore computer science by taking CS8! Although, I didn't take CS8 at UCSB, I remember when I took my first CS class and how intimidating it could get when all these new CS concepts and conventions were being thrown at me. You may find some concepts challenging and might struggle with grasping the fundamentals the first time around but that is perfectly ok. Please never hesitate or feel intimidated to reach out to me with any questions you may have! 

I specifically chose to be a ULA for CS8 because I want to help show students curious about CS how wonderful and supportive the CS community is and how versatile CS can be. Personally, I am fascinated by the intersectionality between the humanities and computer science. I have always wanted to help build a more equitable and sustainable society, so when I discovered how powerful of a tool CS could be in making this change, I was hooked and fell in love with CS. Currently, I am working with Professor Chang and his NLP team as a part of the Early Research Scholars Program(ERSP) to help make the education system more equitable by building a personalized learning model that adapts to each student's individual learning needs rather than teaching the same generalized content that fails to take into account different learning backgrounds. 

Feel free to drop by my office hours or message me via Piazza if you have any questions or would just like someone to talk to! I am always happy to help :)
