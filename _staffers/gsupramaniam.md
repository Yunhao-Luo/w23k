Hi everyone! I’m Gita and I’m a third-year Computer Science student. This is my first quarter being a ULA, so I am looking forward to be involved with this class. This may be a first coding class for some of you, which is very exciting! I hope to  be of help throughout the class the same way that others have helped me.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, drawing, and exploring Santa Barbara. I look forward to meeting everyone!
