# üçÄ  Week 4: Making decisions in programs (Branching)

Dear all,

We‚Äôre almost halfway through the quarter!

- During class and lab, we discussed different data structures such as:
    - Conditionals
    - Booleans and Boolean Operators: Comparison Operators and Logical Operators
    - Branching using the `if`-`elif`-`else` statements
    - `assert` statements for writing tests of return values
        
* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

## ‚è∞ Week 5 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

Check the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-4), for the due dates. They are the same as they've been before.

Upcoming deadlines are:
* ‚è∞  **Tuesday, 2/07 11:59PM**: **LA04**
* ‚è∞  **Wednesday, 2/08 11:59PM**: **LA05 CHECKPOINT** Week 5 zyLabs with the word ‚ÄúCheckpoint‚Äù in their title
* ‚è∞  **Saturday, 2/11 11:59PM**: Weekly reflection - the link to it is available under the **Week 4 tab** on Gauchospace + **PA05** + **CA05**

Important: **Next Monday, 2/06** is the deadline to drop this course without a W. 
> <span style="color:orange"> Keep in mind that the College of Engineering [does not allow this course to be switched to P/NP later]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#note-about-pnp).</span>


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track

* Ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}})

üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 5]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-5), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Carefully read the instructions! Do NOT rush through them. üíé
    - Take non-function code from zyBooks and see if you can turn it into a function.
    - Write tests for it.
    - Feel free to ask us during the office hours if you are on the right track.
    - The condition should involve checking the result of the function call. Please review the examples from class and practice writing them on your own. We'll be asking you to write assert statements on the future quizzes.

## Grade updates

_Your zyBook grades have to be manually transferred to Gauchospace, so the synchronization is not instant._
_Your grades for each week's activities will be updated by Thursday at 1pm. We will process the extensions on the same day - you will receive a confirmation when your extension was processed and the grade was updated._

## Your TO-DO before Week 5

* _Please download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/) before next week._
* Read about [Python installation and working with IDLE]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/ide)
* Create a file called **`week5_laps.py`** using the sample [lab instructions]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/labtocode/#sample-lab-instructions)
* Create an account on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) _using the link provided on Gauchospace_ (underneath the iClicker link)
* Submit your **`week5_labs.py`** file on Gradescope. You can submit an unlimited number of times until the due date. 
* Now is a good time to review [How to Succeed in CSW 8]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success): things will get busier and more complex in the following weeks, so please plan accordingly by creating the study blocks in your calendar.


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources

In addition to the installation guide and a brief intro to IDLE that we provided, here are some optional resources for you to explore.

* Learn about using Python IDLE. Here is a nice [resource](https://realpython.com/python-idle/) for doing so.
* Python Tutor is a cool [resource](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) for running code in Python - we highly recommend it!
    * This website allows you to trace through your code step by step so you can see exactly how your code is being executed.

‚ú® Lastly, here is some great insight on [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W2kXBBFDw4), which is related to our discussion of human-centered design this week.

Wishing you a lovely weekend!
