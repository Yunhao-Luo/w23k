# üçÄ  Week 4: Making decisions in programs (Branching)

Dear all,

We‚Äôre almost halfway through the quarter!

- During class and lab, we discussed different data structures such as:
    - Conditionals
    - Booleans and Boolean Operators: Comparison Operators and Logical Operators
    - Branching using the `if`-`elif`-`else` statements
    - `assert` statements for writing tests of return values
        
* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

* The last section of every chapter in zyBook contains our class notes, which we update afterward with whatever was discussed in class. Sometimes, like this week, there is additional code for you to practice with (the number-guessing game using the `random` module).

## ‚è∞ Week 5 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

Check the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-4), for the due dates. They are the same as they've been before.

Upcoming deadlines are:
* ‚è∞  **Tuesday, 2/07 11:59PM**: **LA04**
* ‚è∞  **Wednesday, 2/08 11:59PM**: **LA05 CHECKPOINT** Week 5 zyLabs with the word ‚ÄúCheckpoint‚Äù in their title
* ‚è∞ **Thursday, 2/09**: in-class Quiz 4 on Gauchospace, covering Week 1-4 content.
* ‚è∞  **Saturday, 2/11 11:59PM**: Weekly reflection - the link to it is available under the **Week 4 tab** on Gauchospace + **PA05** + **CA05**

Important: **Next Monday, 2/06** is the deadline to drop this course without a W. 
> <span style="color:orange"> Keep in mind that the College of Engineering [does not allow this course to be switched to P/NP later]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#note-about-pnp).</span>


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track

* Ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}})

üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 5]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-5), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Carefully read the instructions! Do NOT rush through them. üíé
    - Practice writing reusable and generalizable code using functions.
    - Carefully read about how to write the `assert` statements. Notice the general form of the statement: the keyword `assert` followed by a condition (usually with the `==` operator).

If you ever have any questions, please, _first_ consult the [course syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about) and the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq). A lot of [course structure, helpful hints, and expectations]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#weekly-pattern-and-planning-your-work) are also outlined for you on that page.

## Grade updates

_Your zyBook grades have to be manually transferred to Gauchospace, so the synchronization is not instant._
* Your grades for each week‚Äôs activities will be all updated on **Fridays at 10am**. 
* The extensions will be processed as a batch at the end of each week on **Saturdays by 10 am** - you will receive a confirmation when your extension was processed and the grade was updated.
* Remember that we will not accept retroactive extension requests for previous weeks.

Check the Syllabus about our policies: note that we do not provide additional extensions without proper documentation that shows 1) your name, 2) dates, and 3) the reason/explanation for the extension.


## Syllabus updates

As promised, the Syllabus has been updated with the iClicker participation policy.

Previously, the [Grading]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#grading) section stated
```
10% Course Participation: synchronous participation + weekly reflection;
   2 lowest/missing of each will be dropped
```
Check the updates to the [Grading]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#grading) section to make sure you are aware of the new breakdown.

The iClicker accuracy of your responses (performance) is not going to be included as part of your main score. We do, however, plan to offer an occasional extra credit for those who manage to answer all or almost all questions correctly. üéñÔ∏è


## Your TO-DO before Week 5

* _Please download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/) before next week._
* Read about [Python installation and working with IDLE]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/ide)
* Create a file called **`week5_laps.py`** using the sample [lab instructions]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/labtocode/#sample-lab-instructions)
* Create an account on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) _using the link provided on Gauchospace_ (underneath the iClicker link)
* Submit your **`week5_labs.py`** file on Gradescope. You can submit an unlimited number of times until the due date. 
* Now is a good time to review [How to Succeed in CSW 8]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success): things will get busier and more complex in the following weeks, so please plan accordingly by creating the study blocks in your calendar.


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources

In addition to the installation guide and a brief intro to IDLE that we provided, here are some optional resources for you to explore.

* Learn about using Python IDLE. Here is a nice [resource](https://realpython.com/python-idle/) for doing so.
* Python Tutor is a cool [resource](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) for running code in Python - we highly recommend it!
    * This website allows you to trace through your code step by step so you can see exactly how your code is being executed.

‚ú® Lastly, here is some great insight on [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W2kXBBFDw4) which is related to our discussion of human-centered design this week.

Wishing you a lovely weekend!
