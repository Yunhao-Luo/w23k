# üìö Week 3: Representing data (Variables and Types) 

Dear all,

Hope you‚Äôre having a great time thus far! 
We have been really happy to meet those of you who stopped by the office hours, so don‚Äôt hesitate to join us even if it‚Äôs just to say ‚ÄúHello‚Äù :-)

Before we dive into Week 4, we wanted to take a step back to review what happened in Week 3.
If there is anything from Week 3 that you are still unsure about, especially, regarding indexing and string formatting, make sure that you review and clarify it. The material in this class will begin to build on itself a lot more after Week 4, so make sure that you are comfortable with what we've covered so far. 

- In Week 3 chapter and in the lab, we get to practice different data structures such as:
    - Tuples (Immutable Data Store), 
    - Sets (Mutable Data Store),
    - Lists (Mutable Data Store),
    - Dictionaries (Mutable Data Store)
    - Indexing in ordered data structures and dictionaries
    - Modifying lists and dictionaries
    - Various useful built-in operations in data structures
    - String Formatting
    - Binary Numbers
- The book as well as the slides and the class recording include the table comparing the data structures, which we encourage you to use as a reference.
- In class, we practiced writing functions, differentiating between the `print` and `return` results, as well as how the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block affects the code that is imported as a module.
- We had our second quiz (Quiz 2) and the results have been released on Gauchospace. 
    - Quizzes are scheduled to take place each Thursday at the start of the class.
    - Any regrade requests should be submitted through a form that's linked in the quiz description on Gauchospace.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

* Please follow the collaboration guidelines that are outlined in the [Syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about) and that we've discussed in class (including the Piazza posting guidelines)

## ‚è∞ Week 4 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

_Keep in mind that your grades have to be manually transferred to Gauchospace, so the synchronization is not instant. 
Your grades for each week's activities will be updated by Thursday at 1pm. We will process the extensions on the same day - you will receive a confirmation when your extension was processed and the grade was updated._

Upcoming deadlines are:
* ‚è∞ **Saturday, 1/28 11:59PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace + **PA03** + **CA03**
* ‚è∞ **Tuesday, 1/31 11:59PM** Due: **LA03**
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday, 2/1 11:59PM** Due: **LA04 CHECKPOINT**
* ‚è∞ **Saturday, 2/4 11:59PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace + **PA04** + **CA04**


## ‚û°Ô∏è    Staying on Track

As we move into Weeks 4 and 5, this course (as well as your other courses) will begin to pick up the pace. Plan for it and make sure that you stay ahead by ensuring that you finish your reading early and come to class having done your PAs.

üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 4]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-4), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Understand the flow of the program based on the results of Boolean conditions. Practice writing `assert` statements. üíé
    - We will work with branching and `assert` statements a lot more in the following weeks.
    - The "üìé Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.
    - If the "Instructor note" in zyBooks is asking you a question, work through it - chances are, it might appear on a quiz.
* Write down anything that's unclear and ask questions to ask during class.

## Troubleshooting Resource

We have the üêõ [Debugging scenarios and solutions]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/debug) on our course website, which lists many common errors that students run into along with the potential solutions. 
We hope that you'll find it to be a helpful resource. Use it in combination with the [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=display) to visualize what is happening in your code.

Just a reminder: you can find these announcements on the [main course website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/) as well as under the [**Instructor Announcements** on Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/forum/view.php?id=3714289) (which is supposed to email it to you automatically).
We also provide [course structure, helpful hints, and expectations]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#weekly-pattern-and-planning-your-work) to help you stay on track in this course.

‚ú® Do you do a weekly review? <https://nulab.com/learn/collaboration/weekly-review-one/>  Try it out, since staying ahead of your workload and planning your week in advance can help you learn how you work and maybe even feel less overwhelmed. 


We are looking forward to a productive week ahead!
