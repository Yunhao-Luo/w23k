# 🌟 Week 5: Writing reusable, generalizable code (Functions)

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great week! With 50% of the course behind us, we hope you are all enjoying coding in Python and learning more about Computer Science!

- During class this week, we learned about one of the most important topics - functions and testing done via the `assert` statements! 
- We discussed the importance of functions and how they help make the code reusable and remove redundancy. 
- We discussed how to write functions (function definition), how to execute functions (function call), the different kinds of arguments a function takes and how they are different from the function parameters, the different kinds of outputs a function can have, how to output values (print vs. return statement), different python IDEs, and much more.
- We haven’t talked in-depth about the dynamic vs static typing, and namespaces but we will be going over them in the coming weeks, so please read up on them and bring your questions.
- During labs, we went over some concepts taught in class such as function definition and function call. In addition to this, we demonstrated how to upload solutions to Gradescope so that they can be autograded. We also demonstrated how to use IDLE and how it can be helpful to test your code.
    

## Grading
- Quiz 3 results have been released on Gauchospace.
- Due to the confusion regarding the due dates on Gradescope, Week 5 Checkpoint lab score is going to be dropped. The Week 5 Checkpoint labs will be due as usual with the rest of the labs next week.


## ⏰ Week 6 - Due dates and Deadlines ⏰

The deadlines **next week** are:
* ⏰  **Tuesday, 2/14 11:59PM**: **LA05**
* ⏰  **Wednesday, 2/15 11:59PM**: **LA06 CHECKPOINT** Week 6 zyLabs with the word “Checkpoint” in their title
* ⏰ **Thursday, 2/16**: in-class **Quiz 4** on Gauchospace, covering Week 1-5 content.
* ⏰  **Saturday, 2/18 11:59PM**: Weekly reflection - the link to it is available under the **Week 5 tab** on Gauchospace + **PA06** + **CA06**


## ➡️    Staying on Track

🔮 [Looking ahead to Week 6]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-6), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* If you run into errors or tests not passing, carefully re-read the instructions. 💎
    - We will be learning about a very important concept: Loops (Repeating and iterating).
    - Note that the `while` loop needs to have its loop variable initialized _before_ the loop and _also updated inside_ the loop (to get it closer to the sentinel value)
    - Pay close attention to the difference in the behavior of the `range()` when we give it 1, 2, or 3 arguments
    - `continue` jumps back to the top of the loop to evaluate its condition again; `break` causes code execution to break out of the loop
* Write down anything that's unclear and the questions to ask during class


## ➡️    Resources

*_Just for fun_: Here’s a [choose-your-adventure walkthrough with a riddle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15QCrG9R42GL2L6pzKV3AtzNkfPIptU6c/view), implemented in Python. Download the zip file using the link, open it up, and run the `story.py` (if you have IDLE installed, it will open the file automatically if you double-click on it; when it opens, click anywhere inside the file, and then use the `Run -> Run Module` to get started). This adventure is intended to be run on the terminal, so if you know how to do it (or search the web for “run python in terminal”), we recommend doing so for the best experience!

Things are speeding up and we hope that you’ll use this weekend to catch up on anything that’s been unclear or tripping you up. We are here to help you with anything you need – We hope that you’ll make time to recharge yourselves over the weekend :)
