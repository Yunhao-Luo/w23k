# üé≤ Week 9: Storing and Retrieving Data from Files

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great week! With one week left, we hope that you are all looking forward to taking your knowledge to the next level!

- This week, we discussed how to store and retrieve data from files.
- We looked at how to interact with file system using the OS module.
- We saw the `with` statement.
- During labs, we went over some examples of loading and storing data to csv files, which will also appear in the final project.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

## ‚è∞ Week 10 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

The deadlines **next week** are:

* ‚è∞ **Tuesday, 3/14 11:59PM**: **LA09**
* ‚è∞ **Saturday, 3/18 11:59PM**: **Weekly reflection** posted on Gauchospace + **PA10** + **CA10**


üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 10]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-10)
* Start working on the **final project** early! The final project will require more work and is more complex than any previous lab, so it is important to start early.
* Don't panic when your code doesn't behave as expected. It is normal to spend a lot of time debugging the program.
* Testing is important. Fully test your program to make sure your code handles different edge cases. It is always a good practice to start from testing each function, and then test the whole program comprehensively.
* Besides final project, we will also introduce **recursion** next week, which is a very powerful concept.

## ESCI Survey Reminder
* You should all received an email about the ESCI survey. Please fill it out because student evaluation plays a critical role in UCSB's educational mission. Your feedback will help us to imporve the course in the future!

## Final Project Clarification
* As mentioned in this [piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lcl1mbc5frw2cw/post/338), to pass the gradescope tests for final project (checkpoint 1), you need to add two dash lines (each composed of 42 dashes '-') in your print_restaurant_menu function. We apologize for the inconsistency.

## LA08 Deadline Extension
* As mentioned in the email on Wednesday, to ensure that everyone has a chance to work through the Grade Management labs and submit them, we will extend the LA08 deadline until this Saturday (March 11) 23:59. 

## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources
Here is an interesting article talking about csv files that we leared how to read this week: [CSV FORMAT: HISTORY, ADVANTAGES AND WHY IT IS STILL POPULAR](https://bytescout.com/blog/csv-format-history-advantages.html)

We are happy to see that you are working hard and making your way through the difficult weeks of the quarter. Let‚Äôs keep the spirit up. We are here to help you with anything you need -- don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to us through Piazza or attend our office hours during the week ([including the in-person times!]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule) üéä). 

Wishing you all a lovely weekend!
