# üé≤ Week 6: Repeating and Iterating (Loops)

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great week! With 40% of the course left, we hope that you are all looking forward to taking your knowledge to the next level!

- This week, we discussed one of the most important and interesting topics - loops! 
- We deconstructed the two types of loop constructs (`while`, `for`) and their differences, and how they iterate through a range of numbers or even container types. 
- We saw the `range()` function in action and discussed how to write loops using the various forms of range: `range(stop)`, `range(start, stop)`, `range(start, stop, step)`.
- During labs, we went over some concepts reviewed in class such as `while` and `for` loop constructs and how to use the `range()` function for a container type such as a list. We also went through the concept of nested loops.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

## ‚è∞ Week 7 - Due dates and Deadlines ‚è∞

The deadlines **next week** are:

_Note: **Monday 2/20** is a holiday, so there will be no office hours._

* ‚è∞ **Tuesday, 2/21 11:59PM**: **LA06**
* ‚è∞ **Wednesday, 2/22 11:59PM**: **LA07 CHECKPOINT** Week 7 zyLabs with the word ‚ÄúCheckpoint‚Äù in their title
* ‚è∞ **Thursday, 2/23**: in-class **Quiz 5** (starts on Gauchospace, file submission to Gradescope). Quiz covers Week 1-6 content. **Starts at 9:30AM sharp**.
* ‚è∞ **Saturday, 2/25 11:59PM**: **Weekly reflection** posted on Gauchospace + **PA07** + **CA07**



## ‚û°Ô∏è    Preparing for the Quiz
* Continue practicing with the IDE / IDLE to ensure that you can create new files and are [**not** relying on the Python shell]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/ide#warning)
* Practice writing code from scratch (see the tips under the "experiment" bullet point listed [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success/#general-guidelines-on-how-to-succeed-in-a-computing-course))
* If you haven't already, take the Practice Gradescope Quiz that's posted on Gauchospace, and submit your file on Gradescope until you get the full score (_Gradescope allows you to submit an unlimited number of times until the deadline_)
* Review Tuesday's recording (Week 6, Feb 14) to review more tips for IDE tips and Quiz preparation


üîÆ [Looking ahead to Week 7]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-7), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Review your notes from Week 3 about Lists and Dictionaries! üíé
    - In-place modification and modification of a copy of a list is an important distinction.
    - Pay close attention to iterating through the list vs. the dictionary (review our in-class discussion on Thursday).
    - Keep track of the square brackets / parentheses when nesting lists / dictionaries.
    - Make sure that you work through the examples of how to index nested structures.
    - Create your own example of how to nest lists inside a dictionary and dictionaries in a list - feel free to share it on our forum, so others can practice with it too.
    - The "üìé Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.



## ‚û°Ô∏è    Resources

* If you are still confused about if __name__ == ‚Äú__main__‚Äù, have a look at [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example) to read more about it (üêç snake picture alert!). We encourage you to use a template to help you with the function definition and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` in your main.py file.
* Use [Python Tutor to visualize your code](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) and let us know if you have other [debugging tips]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/debug#quick-debugging-tips) that would be helpful to share with others.

## Survey Reminder
* Pinned on Piazza is a post about the Data Buddies survey, [a chance to enter a raffle to win one of ten $20.00 (USD) Amazon gift cards](https://piazza.com/class/lcl1mbc5frw2cw/post/197). The survey closes on **Feb 26, 2023**.


We are happy to see that you are working hard and making your way through the difficult weeks of the quarter. Let‚Äôs keep the spirit up. We are here to help you with anything you need -- don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to us through Piazza or attend our office hours during the week ([including the in-person times!]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule) üéä). 

We hope you‚Äôll get to recharge yourselves over the weekend, since we are moving into the busiest part of the term. 

Wishing you all a lovely weekend!
